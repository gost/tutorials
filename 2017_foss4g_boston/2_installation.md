# 2] GOST installation

# Introduction

In this page installation of GOST is described using Docker.

## Prerequisites

Verify that Docker is installed with command 'docker info'. This command should display system-wide Docker information.

```
$ docker info
Containers: 250
 Running: 0
 Paused: 0
 Stopped: 250
Images: 1062
...
```

Run command 'docker-compose -- version', version should be 1.10 or greater:

```
$ docker-compose --version
docker-compose version 1.13.0, build 1719ceb
```

If Docker is missing, go to <a href="install_docker.md">install_docker</a> for installation instructions.

If you are unable to install Docker, you can try the free online service <a href="http://labs.play-with-docker.com/">play-with-docker</a>, it gives you free Docker machines for 4 hours.

## Installation

Installation of GOST is easy: download the <a href = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gost/docker-compose/master/docker-compose.yml">docker-compose.yml</a> file and run it with 'docker-compose up'.

Note: The first time the 'docker-compose up' command is executed, a bunch of new Docker images will be downloaded and started so please be patient.

```
Linux:
$ curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gost/docker-compose/master/docker-compose-0.5.yml > docker-compose.yml
$ docker-compose up

Windows:
PS Invoke-WebRequest https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gost/docker-compose/master/docker-compose.yml -UseBasicParsing | Select -ExpandProperty Content > docker-compose.yml
PS docker-compose up
```
The system is ready when log messages appear like:

```
gost_1       | 2017/06/26 09:49:21 Started GOST HTTP Server on :8080
node-red_1   | 26 Jun 09:49:23 - [info] Started flows
gost-db_1    | LOG:  database system is ready to accept connections
mosquitto_1  | 1499082438: New client connected from 172.18.0.5 as gost (c1, k300).
```

If you inspect the docker-compose file, you will see the various parts of the installation:

- geodan/gost: contains the GOST service (written in Golang)

- geodan/gost-db: contains the GOST database (based on PostgreSQL + PostGIS)

- geodan/gost-dashboard: contains GOST front-end + proxyserver (based on Nginx)

- nodered/node-red-docker: contains Node-RED

- toke/mosquitto: contains Mosquitto broker for MQTT 


## Testing

Open a browser and test the following addresses:

- http://localhost:8080 : should run the dashboard

- http://localhost:8080/v1.0: should run the GOST endpoint

- http://localhost:1880 : should run Node-RED user interface

## Stopping GOST

If you want to stop GOST press control-c and run 'docker-compose down':

```
$ docker-compose down

Removing dockercompose_dashboard_1 ... done
Removing dockercompose_gost_1 ... done
Removing dockercompose_gost-db_1 ... done
Removing dockercompose_mosquitto_1 ... done
Removing dockercompose_node-red_1 ... done
Removing network dockercompose_default
```

If you want to remove all presistent data (warning: all GOST data will be removed) and restart clean, add the -v option:

```
$ docker-compose down -v

Removing network dockercompose_default
WARNING: Network dockercompose_default not found.
Removing volume dockercompose_mosquitto_conf
Removing volume dockercompose_mosquitto_data
Removing volume dockercompose_nodered
Removing volume dockercompose_postgis
```

Use docker-compose up again to restart GOST
```
$ docker-compose up
```
